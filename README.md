# On NAS, clone repository and run:
./deploy.sh production
```

### Cloud Platforms

#### Firebase Hosting + Cloud Run

# Build and push to Google Container Registry
docker build -t gcr.io/your-project/email-backend .
docker push gcr.io/your-project/email-backend

# Deploy to Cloud Run
gcloud run deploy email-backend \
  --image gcr.io/your-project/email-backend \
  --platform managed \
  --allow-unauthenticated
```

```

### Default Teams
The system comes with three pre-configured teams:
1. **Engineering** - Software development and technical roles
2. **Product** - Product management and design roles  
3. **Marketing** - Marketing and growth roles

### Building from Source
```bash
# Clone repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd Email-Backend

# Build with Maven
mvn clean package

# Run tests
mvn test

# Run application
mvn spring-boot:run
```

## Monitoring and Health Checks

### Health Endpoints
- `/health` - Application health status
- `/actuator/health` - Detailed health information
- `/actuator/info` - Application information

### Docker Health Checks
The Docker containers include built-in health checks that monitor application availability.

### Prometheus Metrics
When deployed with monitoring, metrics are available at `/actuator/prometheus`.

## Security

### Production Security Features
- CORS configuration for API access
- Rate limiting via nginx
- Security headers (X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options, etc.)
- Non-root user in Docker container
- Input validation and sanitization

### SSL/HTTPS Setup
Uncomment SSL configuration in `nginx.conf` and provide certificates:
```bash
# Create SSL directory and add certificates
mkdir ssl
# Add cert.pem and key.pem to ssl/ directory
# Update docker-compose.yml to mount SSL directory
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Email not sending**: Check email configuration in `.env` file
2. **Port conflicts**: Change PORT in `.env` or docker-compose.yml
3. **Permission issues**: Ensure Docker has proper permissions
4. **Memory issues**: Adjust JVM settings in Dockerfile if needed

### Logs and Debugging
```bash
# View application logs
./deploy.sh logs

# View all container logs
docker-compose logs

# Debug email configuration
curl http://localhost:3000/api/teams/email/status
```
